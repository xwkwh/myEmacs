(defmacro nasy/protect-macros (&rest body)
  "Eval BODY, protecting macros from incorrect expansion.
This macro should be used in the following situation:
Some form is being evaluated, and this form contains as a
sub-form some code that will not be evaluated immediately, but
will be evaluated later. The code uses a macro that is not
defined at the time the top-level form is evaluated, but will be
defined by time the sub-form's code is evaluated. This macro
handles its arguments in some way other than evaluating them
directly. And finally, one of the arguments of this macro could
be interpreted itself as a macro invocation, and expanding the
invocation would break the evaluation of the outer macro.
You might think this situation is such an edge case that it would
never happen, but you'd be wrong, unfortunately. In such a
situation, you must wrap at least the outer macro in this form,
but can wrap at any higher level up to the top-level form."

- An unquoted list of package symbols (i.e. BODY is evaluated once both magit

3. Supports compound package statements (see below)
